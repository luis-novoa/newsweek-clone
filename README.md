# Newsweek Replica

In this project, the [Newsweek Website](https://www.newsweek.com/) was rebuild using the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) focusing on its responsiveness, as proposed by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap). This is part of the [Microverse curriculum](https://www.microverse.org/#world-class-curriculum). The result can be seen in [this live webpage](https://raw.githack.com/luis-novoa/newsweek-clone/development/index.html).

# Workflow

1 - Create the github repository.

2 - Create a branch to work on (never code in the master branch).

3 - Write the HTML structure of the page using semantic HTML tags and prioritizing the mobile version.

4 - Divide the code into sections accordingly to the ones of the website.

5 - Style the page from top to bottom, and from the lower resolution to the bigger one, prioritizing the use of Bootstrap, but applying your own CSS rules as needed, creating sections corresponding to the main elements of the page and respecting the order in which the labels are presented in HTML.

6 - Save your progress constantly on Github. This ensures plenty of returning points in case they are needed.

7 - Create a new branch whenever you feel the need to make a major change in your coding structure, so you can test it without compromising the work already achieved.

8 - After finishing the project, send the HTML and CSS files to W3C's online file validators.
